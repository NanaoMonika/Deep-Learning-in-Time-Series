## Project: Capstone Proposal and Capstone Project

This project aims to use machine learning to try to solve a Kaggle competition problem - Web Traffic Time Series Forecasting (https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting). 

A report is generated in the PDF file. 

All the python code is implemented in the IPython notebook.


## Dataset

The dataset is from a Kaggle competition and here is the link:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting/data


## python libraries

#### pandas
	It is mainly used to import, save, join and analyze dataframes like using read_csv, DataFrame, merge, etc.

#### numpy
	It is mainly used to transform array like taking log() and exp().

#### sklearn
	Its model evaluation metrics and preprocessing functions are used.
	
#### keras
	It is used to build neural network architecture, train and save the model, and predict new dataset like using models, layers, callbacks
