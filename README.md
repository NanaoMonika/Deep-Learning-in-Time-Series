# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree
## Specializations
## Project: Capstone Proposal and Capstone Project
### Deep Learning in Time Series Prediction


This project aims to use machine learning to try to solve a Kaggle competition problem - Web Traffic Time Series Forecasting (https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting). 

A report is generated in the PDF file. 

All the python code is implemented in the IPython notebook.


## Dataset

The dataset is from a Kaggle competition and here is the link:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting/data


## Python libraries

- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)

It is mainly used to import, save, join and analyze dataframes like using read_csv, DataFrame, merge, etc.

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)

It is mainly used to transform array like taking log() and exp().

- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

Its model evaluation metrics and preprocessing functions are used.
	
#### keras

It is used to build neural network architecture, train and save the model, and predict new dataset like using models, layers, callbacks, etc..

- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

It is used to visualize time series and other figures.
